        <h2>The project that we did in this for this interval was the <br> Vindinium game, which consisted us making bots and making a <br>code for them to attack. One thing that the bots can attack are<br> mines and when the bots do so, they earn gold from them. There<br> are four bots that are going to compete against each other.<br> You can create multiple codes for the bots to do things such as attack<br> other bots that are closest to your bot, bots with the lowest health,<br> bots with most gold,and bots with most mines. The bot that has the<br>most gold is crowned the winner.</h2>

        <p>My bot attacked other bots with the klowest health. My bot does this by finding the closest bot with the lowest health.</p>
        <p>Some htings that my bot does is go to taverns and attack bots. It does that because of the if else statement that I created which allows the bot to go to the closest tavern and the bot to find the nearest freemine.</p>
        <p>My bot did do what I wanted it to do, it did attack the bots with the lowest health and goes for the free mines.</p>
        <p>It was very complicated, I had no idea how to make my bot work at all. and I still get confused with AI</p>
